# Color-Ona

## History
From what I understand, most people hate their collegiate *Software Engineering* courses.  They're long, grueling, and, quite often, boring as hell.  That wasn't the case for me.  During my Fall 2020 *Software Engineering* class at Canisius College, a group of three other students and I formed **McDouble Productions** to create the world's greatest video game, **Color-Ona**!  The course's laboratory section for the entire semester was dedicated to working on this project.  It's an agility-based arcade game reminiscent of **Color Switch**.  We developed it in **Java** using the **LibGDX** game development framework.  It wouldn't important correctly from **GitLab**, so please forgive me for the lack of commits.  It's a shame; some of those comments were dreadfully funny.

## Team

## Documentation
We all love some documentation, right? ...right?  Since some of the documentation doesn't lend well to README markup (presentations and formatting), I'm going to instead paste their shareable links here.  Feel free to check them out during your spare time.

# Final Notes
Please message me if you want a personal copy of this game.  It'll be my pleasure to share the JAR file with you.

Egads!  After some cursory testing, I noticed that this isn't the actual *final* version of the game.  This version is incapable of infinitely generating the world map.  If I can find the time (to rewrite code I haven't seen in two years), I'll try fixing this.  Perhaps even tinker with the overall architecature.
